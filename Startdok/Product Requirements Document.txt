Product Requirements Document – “SubTrack DK”
A super-light mobile app that discovers all active subscriptions for Danish users and provides one-tap access to cancel pages.
________________________________________
1. Problem Statement
Danish consumers lose money on forgotten, fragmented subscriptions. They want a single, safe overview and an ultra-simple off-ramp without digging through bank statements or email receipts.

2. Goals & Success Metrics
Objective	KPI (North-Star)	Target at Post-MVP (3 mo)
Discover most recurring charges	% users who see ≥3 subscriptions detected	≥ 70 %
Drive actual cancellations	Avg. cancelled subs per Monthly Active User (MAU)	0.8 / MAU
Prove retention value	30-day rolling retention (D30)	45 %
Stay friction-free	Onboarding completion time	≤ 2 min (bank connect → list)
Stay compliant	Data-protection incidents	0

3. In-Scope Personas
Persona	“Job-to-be-done”	Pain Point
Budget-Max (25-35, tech-savvy)	Track all auto-charges, cut waste fast	Can’t remember what’s billed on which card
Family CFO (35-50)	Audit household spending quarterly	Manual Excel + PDF statements is slow
Student Saver (18-25)	Avoid overdraft from forgotten trials	Lacks overview, forgets to cancel trials
